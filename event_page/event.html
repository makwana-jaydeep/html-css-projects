    <h1>EVENTS AND SHOWS</h1>
    <P>
        
        With the idea of imparting programming
        knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT
        Roorkee alumnus started a dream,
        GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
        excites you or you feel stifled,
        wondering how to prepare for
        interview questions or
        how to ace data structures and
        algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a
        one-stop solution. With every
        tick of time, we are adding arrows
        in our quiver. From articles on
        various computer science subjects
        to programming problems for practice,
        from basic to premium courses, from
        technologies to entrance examinations,
        we have been building ample content
        with superior quality. In a short
        span, we have built a community of
        1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
        Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors
        in various colleges across the nation.
        Our success stories include a lot of
        students who benefitted in their
        placements and landed jobs at tech
        giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
        network of geeks and we are only a
        fraction of it yet.
